# C++ Language Syntax and Code Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the C++ Language Syntax and Code Repository! This repository is designed to be a comprehensive resource for learning, referencing, and mastering the C++ programming language. Whether you are a beginner looking to understand the basics or an experienced programmer seeking advanced techniques, this repository has something for everyone.

## Contents

### 1. Syntax Reference
- **Basic Syntax:** Variables, Data Types, Operators, Control Structures (if, switch, loops)
- **Functions:** Declaration, Definition, Overloading, Inline Functions, Recursion
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction
- **Pointers and References:** Pointer Arithmetic, Smart Pointers, References
- **Arrays and Strings:** Declaration, Initialization, STL Arrays, std::string
- **STL (Standard Template Library):** Vectors, Lists, Sets, Maps, Iterators, Algorithms
- **File I/O:** Streams, Reading from and Writing to Files, File Handling Functions
- **Preprocessor Directives:** Macros, Conditional Compilation, Include Guards
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** `new`, `delete`, RAII
- **Error Handling:** Exceptions, try-catch Blocks, std::exception

### 2. Code Examples
- **Hello World:** The classic first program in C++.
- **Basic Calculations:** Simple arithmetic operations.
- **Control Structures:** Examples of `if-else`, `switch-case`, `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- **Functions and Recursion:** Examples demonstrating function usage, overloading, and recursive solutions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Practical examples using classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Pointers and References:** Examples using pointers, smart pointers, and references.
- **STL Usage:** Examples using vectors, lists, sets, maps, and algorithms.
- **File Operations:** Reading from and writing to files using streams.
- **Memory Management:** Examples of dynamic memory allocation and RAII principles.
- **Error Handling:** Examples showing how to handle errors effectively using exceptions.
